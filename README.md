# VAE-GAN in Tensorflow
Implementation (with modifications) of [*Autoencoding beyond pixels using a learned similarity metric*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09300)  
As the name indicates, VAE-GAN replaces GAN's generator with a variational auto-encoder, resulting in a model with both inference and generation components.
